# Simple Counter App

This project is a **Simple Counter App** that allows users to **increase**, **decrease**, or **reset** a displayed numeric value. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Increment**: Increase the current value by 1.
- **Decrement**: Decrease the current value by 1.
- **Reset**: Reset the value back to its initial state (0).
  
## How It Works

- The app consists of three buttons for incrementing, decrementing, and resetting the value.
- The value is displayed in an input field, which updates as the buttons are clicked.
- JavaScript is used to handle button click events and modify the displayed value dynamically.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the app.
- **CSS3**: Styling of the app (external stylesheet: `style.css`).
- **JavaScript**: Logic for incrementing, decrementing, and resetting the value (external script: `script.js`).
